    <h1><u>Mahatma gandhi</u></h1>
    <p>
        Mahatma Gandhi <b>(born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi)</b> was an <u>Indian
            lawyer,
            politician, social activist, and writer </u> who became the leader of the<u>Indian Independence Movement</u>
        against
        British rule. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed
        for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.

        In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration
        of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could
        hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the
        Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma
        Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.

        Youth
        Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His father—<mark>Karamchand Gandhi</mark>, who was
        the dewan
        (chief minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat
        state) under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able
        administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes, their long-suffering subjects, and
        the headstrong British political officers in power.

        Gandhi’s mother, <mark>Putlibai</mark>, was completely absorbed in religion, did not care much for finery or
        jewelry, divided
        her time between her home and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out in days and nights of nursing
        whenever there was sickness in the family. Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the
        Hindu god Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian religion whose chief tenets are
        nonviolence and the belief that everything in the universe is eternal. Thus, he took for granted ahimsa
        (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between
        adherents of various creeds and sects.
    <p>
        The educational facilities at Porbandar were rudimentary; in the primary school that Mohandas attended, the
        children wrote the alphabet in the dust with their fingers. Luckily for him, his father became dewan of Rajkot,
        another princely state. Though Mohandas occasionally won prizes and scholarships at the local schools, his
        record was on the whole mediocre. One of the terminal reports rated him as “good at English, fair in Arithmetic
        and weak in Geography; conduct very good, bad handwriting.” He was married at the age of 13 and thus lost a year
        at school. A diffident child, he shone neither in the classroom nor on the playing field. He loved to go out on
        long solitary walks when he was not nursing his by then ailing father (who died soon thereafter) or helping his
        mother with her household chores.

        Civil rights leader Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. delivers a speech to a crowd of approximately 7,000 people
        on May 17, 1967 at UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza in Berkeley, California. He had learned, in his words,<s> "to
            carry
            out the orders of the elders, not to scan them"</s>.With such extreme
        passivity, it is not surprising that he should have gone through a phase of adolescent rebellion, marked by
        secret atheism, petty thefts, furtive smoking, and—most shocking of all for a boy born in a <mark>Vaishnava
            family</mark>—meat eating. His adolescence was probably no stormier than that of most children of his age and class.
        What was extraordinary was the way his youthful transgressions ended.

    <p>Gandhi took his studies seriously and tried to brush up on his English and Latin by taking the University of
        London matriculation examination. But, during the three years he spent in England, his main preoccupation was
        with personal and moral issues rather than with academic ambitions. The transition from the half-rural
        atmosphere of Rajkot to the <abbr title="meaning">cosmopolitan</abbr>  life of London was not easy for him. As he struggled painfully to adapt
        himself to Western food, dress, and etiquette, he felt awkward. His vegetarianism became a continual source of
        embarrassment to him; <u>his friends warned him that it would wreck his studies as well as his health</u>. Fortunately
        for him he came across a vegetarian restaurant as well as a book providing a reasoned defense of vegetarianism,
        which henceforth became a matter of conviction for him, not merely a legacy of his Vaishnava background. The
        missionary zeal he developed for vegetarianism helped to draw the pitifully shy youth out of his shell and gave
        him a new poise. He became a member of the executive committee of the London Vegetarian Society, attending its
        conferences and contributing articles to its journal.
