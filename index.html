    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><mark>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</mark></h1>
    <p> <i>Shivaji <b>(19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680)</b> was an Indian ruler and a member of the <b>Bhonsle dynasty</b>.
        Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the
        Maratha Confederacy. Shivaji was the founder of the Maratha Empire which later become the Maratha Confederacy.

        Shivaji offered passage and his service to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to invade the declining Sultanate of
        Bijapur. After <s>Aurangzeb's</s>departure for the north due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories
        ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals. Following his defeat at the hands of Jai Singh I in the
        Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief
        and was conferred with the title of<q></q>  by Aurangzeb. He undertook military expeditions on behalf of the
        Mughal empire for a brief duration.Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and
        hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golconda,the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European
        colonial powers.

        In <mark>1674</mark> ,<abbr title="Chatrapati shivaji maharaj">Shivaji</abbr> was coronated as the king despite
        opposition from local Brahmins. Praised for his
        chivalrous treatment of women, Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims
        and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere
        of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.

        Shivaji's legacy was revived by Jyotirao Phule about two centuries after his death. Later on, he came to be
        glorified by Indian nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and appropriated by Hindutva
        activists.</i>

    <mark><b><u>Early life :</u></b></mark>
    <br> 
    
  <i>
    Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars disagree on
    his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth
    (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a local deity, the Goddess Shivai Devi.

    Shivaji belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan.Shivaji's father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was a Maratha
    general who served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of
    Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.His paternal
    grandfather Maloji <mark>(1552–1597)</mark> was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet
    of "Raja" . He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan, and Indapur to provide for military expenses. He
    was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence <mark> (c. 1590) </mark>.

    At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates : Bijapur, Ahmednagar,
    Golkonda, and the Mughal Empire. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the
    Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.
